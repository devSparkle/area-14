An awesome thank you to the entire Area 14 team, which have allowed their work to be made available to the community, under the LICENSE.

The work of creators that have not explicitly signed their rights, or who could not be contacted for approval, has been removed.

## Featured Games

We'll be building a small list of games here, which have undertaken the work to bring back A14 to a playable standard, or have created museum games to share their memories of this small part of our collective history. *Contact any unnamed.games staff to get your game listed!*
